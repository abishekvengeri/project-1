# Incident Response Report: Ransomware Traffic Analysis

## Summary
The Ransomware Traffic Detector analyzed sample DNS and proxy logs, identifying potential ransomware activity:
- 2 High-severity alerts for connections to known C2 domains.
- 2 Medium-severity alerts for large file transfers (>5MB).

## Detected Threats
- **C2 Domain Matches**:
  - 2025-10-23 10:00:03: Client 192.168.1.100 -> malicious-c2-domain.com
  - 2025-10-23 10:00:04: Client 192.168.1.101 -> ransomware-site.net
- **Large File Transfers**:
  - 2025-10-23 10:00:02: 5.24MB to malicious-c2-domain.com
  - 2025-10-23 10:00:03: 10.48MB to ransomware-site.net

## Mitigation Steps
- Isolate affected clients (192.168.1.100, 192.168.1.101) from the network.
- Block C2 domains (`malicious-c2-domain.com`, `ransomware-site.net`) at the firewall.
- Investigate large file transfers for signs of ransomware encryption or exfiltration.

## Recommendations
- Deploy real-time monitoring to detect ongoing threats.
- Update threat intelligence feeds regularly.
- Conduct forensic analysis on affected systems to confirm ransomware infection.
